# Kaggle - The Hewlett Foundation: Automated Essay Scoring
Word Frequency Preprocessing Feature Using NLP

Students with low scores, such as a 2, use fewer common words in their essays, while students with a score of 12 use more common words in their essays. Based on this observation, the more common words students write in their essays, the more positive the effect on their essay scores.
- First identify the frequency of words mentioned in every essay and then identify the common words. Finally count how many common words are in each essay to identify if there is a correlation on the score and the common words.
- Test Run focuses on a small sample that contains 18 human scored essays. From the 18 essays there is 3 essays for each score: 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2.
